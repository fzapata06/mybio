	<p>I have been in the technology staffing industry for thge past 20 years. I have placed hundreds of developers and have met with also hundreds, if not thousands of technical manager, including CTO's and CIO's.</p>

	<p>Technology has always been a big passion of mine and for several years now, learning to code became an obsesion. I have recently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, and I am very much looking forward to what I will be able to do with this new skill.</p>
